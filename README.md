# Discord-KaiOS-Unofficial

Unofficial Discord client for KaiOS devices (tested on Cingular Flip IV on 2.5.3). Also technically works in the browser (briefly tested in Firefox 45 on Windows XP), but such configurations are unsupported.

Note that using this is technically against Discord's TOS, and that I take no responsibility for what they do about it.

Changes made by Cyan:

-   migrate to ES6 classes(syntactic sugar ftw!!!)
-   support node.js (require and import should work, install dependecies...)

Future:
if the backend still works i'll make more ui, will also try to implement channels
